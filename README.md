## The skills presented in this project:

- Basic C++
- Object oriented programming
- Error elimination

## Project issues:

There is no cross-platform compatibility. I used "system("chcp 1251>nul");". Unfortunately, this only works on Windows. It won't start on another OS. In other projects, I will try to fix this error, but I will leave this one like this.



## How can I run it on my computer?

- Download the repository
- Unzip the .zip
- Open the folder and find the file "Main.cpp"
- Open this file using the code editor you use
